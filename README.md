# spaceship-dealer-website 🚀

This repository contains the files of one of my silly projects: A spaceship dealer website! 😁 This project is supposed to be a fictional website for a space ship dealer set in the year 2122.

This project has parts that are mainly hard-coded and you cannot add item in your cart and proceed with payment. This is more of an HTML / CSS type of project.

## What I used 🔨
My goal with this project was to build my own project from scratch to practice HTML, CSS and a bit of JavScript.

## Extra learning ✔
I also wanted to practice some of the common fundamentals of HTML and CSS such has full responsivity, grid layout and adding a page loader.

## Responsiveness 📱
This project is responsive on any devices.
